ABSTRACT 
Agriculture is the most important sector of Indian Economy and key development 
in the raise of sedentary human civilization. Over 60.45% of India’s total land and 
11% of world’s total land is under agriculture. World’s second largest agriculture 
activity is done in India after United States. But there are many problems in taking 
care of agriculture. 
Generally every farmer is aware of how much time, the water supply has to be 
provided to the field. After completion of watering the field, the farmer need to 
switch OFF the motor. Here the major problem arises when the farmer forget to 
switch off the motor or his field is far away that leads to over supply of water. This 
may cause to suffocate the plant roots and then plants could not survive. Here, 
returning to the field to switch the motor consumes time and utilizes energy of 
human.
The aim of this project is to help farmers in the way of switching motor effectively 
based on fixed timings. This helps to achieve good crop yield. In this timing 
methodology, motor switching completely depends on the estimated time of 
human that how much time is required to water the field.
